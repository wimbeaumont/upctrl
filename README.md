# upctrl
programs etc for the practical exercises  uP controlled measurement setups

These  programs are specific for practical exercises  for students physics to see how they can make use of uP (Raspberry Pi) and programming logic to do measurements.  The aim is that the student gets insight of the possibilities to use a uP to realize a test setup and what are the limitation and how these can be overcome with the help of digital logic (FPGA's)
