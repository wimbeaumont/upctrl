# upctrl
programs etc for the practical exercises  uP controlled measurement setups

These  programs are specific for practical exercises  for sudents physics to see how they can make use of uP ( Raspberry Pi) and programming logic to do measurements.  The aim is that the studen gets insight of the possiblilties to use a uP to realise a test setup and what are the limitation and how these can be overcome with the help of digital logic ( FPGA's) 

directories :

src :  the C code of the programs
incl:  C headers file 
bin : destination code for the executables 
doc : additional documentation of the project
		- picute of the setup 
firmware :  VHDL code used in the project 
python :  files in python.  based on the C++ files
