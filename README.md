# upctrl
programs etc for the practical exercises  uP controlled measurement setups

These  programs are specific for practical exercises  for sudents physics to see how they can make use of uP ( Raspberry Pi) and programming logic to do measurements.  The aim is that the studen gets insight of the possiblilties to use a uP to realise a test setup and what are the limitation and how these can be overcome with the help of digital logic ( FPGA's)
