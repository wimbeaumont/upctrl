# firmware 

Here you can find the firmware code used for the project.
It is a snap shot in time  as this repository is not used in de design application. 
So changes in this repository will be overwriten. 

The *.sch are schematic files that are generated (  and can be "read"   by ISE 14.7 

exception is digpr4 , digpr2 ,pract1, SiPm  these  are  the design directory  see README.md in that directory 

history
mrt 2022  make subdir src for digpr1 and digpr 4 so more clear what are generated files ( not on git ) and what are the source files (on git) to regenerate the project
When the project is first time generated the ip cores have to be re-generated also
digpr4 is converting to the digpr4 diff version. no diff output yet
